        <h2 class="heading-2">Game Synopsis</h2>
        <p class="text">
            <i>Mallow Mystery</i> is a noir-inspired detective RPG set in the candy-themed city of Dulton, inspired by the 1930s and real cities like New York, Budapest and Rotterdam.<br><br>
            The plot, inspired by renowned detective titles like Miles Edgeworth Investigations, Return of the Obra Dinn and L.A. Noire, revolves around an ordinary office worker - Milton Brown, who sets out to solve the mysterious death of his childhood friend after police dismisses the case.<br><br>
            The colourful candy-themed setting is used to contrast and highlight the underlying darker themes of the story like murder, corruption and poverty. The gameplay is centred around the exploration of the setting, ranging from clean, wealthy districts to poverty-stricken ghetto-like areas, where the player finds clues and tries to connect them to the overarching story.<br><br>
            The player is often left to their own devices, allowing for multiple endings depending on how well they can unravel the story and which choices they made. The game is aimed at people who enjoy complex narratives and world building in games.
